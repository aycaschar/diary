my coding journey
1. Day: I have install an emoji extension for Visual 
studio Code Editor and found out how it works. I worked on 16th project of JavaScript30 which is about to create a shadow function. First issue was calculate x and y accordind to child element and then styling the text shadow with mousemove event. I have changed the color and text to be more clear about the project. The day is not over. I m going to start Front End Libraries on freecodecamp. My aim is to finish Bootstrap today.
