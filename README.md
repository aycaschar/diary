my coding journey
1. Day: I have install an emoji extension for Visual 
studio Code Editor and found out how it works. I worked on 16th project of JavaScript30 which is about to create a shadow function. First issue was calculate x and y according to child element and then styling the text shadow with mousemove event. I have changed the color and text to be more clear about the project. The day is not over. I m going to start Front End Libraries on freecodecamp. My aim is to finish Bootstrap today. 
Boom-shakalaka!Bootstrap mission is completed. It was nice to repeat all bootstrap classes and build nested div tags
2.Day: I have finished JQuery library on freecodecamp. I have learnt .addClass,.css,.html,.appendTo,.clone,.parent(),.children() methods and had fun.
17th project of JavaScript30 is also done. It was about sorting band names array without articles with regex method. I have checked my regex notes for refresh my memory. I like to work on this project.Because it was simple but usefull.
